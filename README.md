KeySeize v1.0
KeySeize Allows you to record all keystrokes typed on a victims machine as does the average keylogger. What differentiates KeySeize from the normal keylogger is the abilities. KeySeize uploads the keystrokes every 60 seconds to the specified server. After doing so you can access the log anywhere with the Key Stream Option. Future updates will include data parsing for passwords.
usage:
 ./keyseize.py (for help)
